# Flight_Price_Prediction
DESCRIPTION: The objective of this project is to use Machine Learning Algorithm and draw some predictions about the price of the flight based on some features.

Libraries Used: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Sklearn

RESULT: After performing Data Preprocessing, Exploratory Data Analysis and Feature Seletion techniques, Random Forest Regressor has been used to build the Model which is giving an Accuracy of around 81% on Test data.
